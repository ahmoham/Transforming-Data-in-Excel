# Using Excel to Clean, Transform, and Visualize Data
In this project, I will be cleaning, transforming, and creating a dashboard using a bike sales dataset.

The attached excel file contains the original dataset called "bike buyers", a working sheet, pivot tables, and the visualization of the data. 

Here is final dashboard for the project.
